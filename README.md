# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me  
I’m **Andreas Pattichis**, an MSc candidate in Artificial Intelligence, passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world challenges.

🌍 Currently based in **Barcelona, Spain**, and open to global opportunities.  

🎓 **MSc in AI @ EMAI**  
- Fully-funded scholarship recipient.  
- Gaining diverse expertise through studies at top universities across Europe.

🚀 **Current Role: AI Research Scientist in Medical Imaging @ UPF**  
- Integrated AI-driven models into clinical pipelines to create non-invasive diagnostic tools for pediatric healthcare.
- Addressed challenges in 3D craniofacial anomaly detection for infants, focusing on developmental variability and limited datasets.
- Integrated advanced AI methodologies (Spiral Autoencoders, SVAE, SVQ-VAE) for enhanced 3D baby face analysis.
- Researched 3D mesh processing using GNNs and spiral convolution to extract geometric features while maintaining mesh topology.
- Implemented preprocessing and augmentation techniques (Gaussian noise, random flipping) to improve model robustness.
-  Evaluated models using criteria like reconstruction loss, KL divergence, and vertex anomaly thresholds, achieving high precision in anomaly detection.
