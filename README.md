# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me  
I’m **Andreas Pattichis**, an MSc candidate in Artificial Intelligence, passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world challenges.

🌍 Currently based in **Barcelona, Spain**, and open to global opportunities.  

### 🎓 **MSc in AI @ EMAI**  
- **Fully-funded scholarship** recipient.  
- Gaining diverse expertise through studies at top universities across Europe.

### 🚀 **Current Role: AI Research Intern in Medical Imaging @ UPF**  
- Worked with Children’s National Hospital in Washington D.C. and UPF to develop a low-cost 3D facial scanning system for early detection of craniofacial anomalies in infants.
- Explored novel AI methodologies for 3D baby face analysis by integrating Spiral Convolutions with Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to enhance 3D mesh reconstruction and anomaly detection accuracy.
- Experimented with preprocessing and augmentation techniques, including Gaussian noise injection and random flipping, to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting
- Conducted experimental evaluation using multiple anomaly detection criteria (such as reconstruction loss, KL divergence, cosine similarity) to find the most efficient combination for each model.
